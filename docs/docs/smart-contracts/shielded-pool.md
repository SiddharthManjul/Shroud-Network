# ShieldedPool Contract

The core contract managing the shielded pool for a single ERC20 token.

## Overview

Each `ShieldedPool` instance wraps one ERC20 token. It maintains:
- An incremental Merkle tree (depth 20, Poseidon hashing) of note commitments
- A nullifier registry for double-spend prevention
- Historical root storage (last 100 roots) for proof freshness tolerance

## Functions

### deposit

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 amount, uint256 commitment) external
```

Locks ERC20 tokens in the pool and inserts a note commitment into the Merkle tree.

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `amount` | Token amount in whole units (contract scales by `amountScale`) |
| `commitment` | The note commitment (Poseidon hash) |

**Events:** `Deposit(commitment, leafIndex, timestamp)`

:::info
Deposit amount is visible on-chain (the ERC20 `transferFrom` is public). Privacy begins after deposit.
:::

### transfer

Executes a private transfer inside the pool. Consumes one note (via nullifier) and creates two new notes.

The contract:
1. Checks `merkleRoot` is in the known roots set
2. Checks `nullifierHash` hasn't been spent
3. Verifies the Groth16 proof against 4 public inputs
4. Marks nullifier as spent
5. Inserts both new commitments into the Merkle tree
6. Emits `PrivateTransfer` event with encrypted memos

### withdraw

Exits the shielded pool. Consumes a note and releases ERC20 tokens to the recipient.

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `proof` | Groth16 proof bytes |
| `amount` | Withdrawal amount (public, needed to release ERC20) |
| `changeCommitment` | Change note commitment (0 if full withdrawal) |
| `recipient` | Address to receive the ERC20 tokens |

## Merkle tree

- **Type:** Incremental append-only
- **Hash:** Poseidon (t=3, 2 inputs)
- **Depth:** 20 (supports 1,048,576 commitments)
- **Zero values:** `zero[0] = 0`, `zero[i] = Poseidon(zero[i-1], zero[i-1])`
- **Root history:** Circular buffer of last 100 roots
- Leaves are never removed — a "spent" note still exists in the tree, its nullifier just prevents reuse

## Gas costs

| Operation | Estimated Gas |
|---|---|
| Deposit | ~300,000 - 400,000 |
| Transfer | ~450,000 - 550,000 |
| Withdraw | ~350,000 - 450,000 |
